I'm currently switching over to web development in order to hone my programming skill even more! ⚙️<br>
I started my journey into web dev around **July 2022**, until now, I've made a number of projects so far, in which most of them consist of personal sites made for friends.


<h1>What I've learnt - My Skillset</h1>
I'm lucky enough to have a background in <u>Game Development</u>, it makes it a breeze to learn another programming language like javascript as I have already grasp most of programming concepts.
