I'm currently switching over to web development in order to hone my programming skill even more! ⚙️<br>
I started my journey into web dev around **July 2022**, until now, I've made a number of projects so far, in which most of them consist of personal sites made for friends.


<h1>What I've learnt - My Skillset</h1>
I'm lucky enough to have a background in <u>Game Development</u>, it makes it a breeze to learn another programming language like javascript as I have already grasp most of programming concepts.

in the span of July 2022 - Nov 2022, I have gone from barely knowing anything about the web to being able to use these confidently:

<h2>I'm Currently Learning/Working On</h2>
In any practice, Fundamentals is the most important to grasp as such, I'm now making a bunch of **vanilla.js** before jumping into a framework.

<h2>I will be learning - Queue</h2>
I will delve deeper into the FE world first and jump into a JavaScript framework that is:
*React.js*
